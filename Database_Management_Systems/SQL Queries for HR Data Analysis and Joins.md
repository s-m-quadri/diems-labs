Section 1: Task Description

In this task, we will be working with a database schema provided by W3Resource for an HR system. The schema consists of multiple tables, including "employees" and "departments." We will use SQL queries to perform data retrieval and analysis on this schema.

Section 2: Question 1

Title: Retrieve Employee and Department Information

SQL query:

```sql
SELECT employees.FIRST_NAME, employees.LAST_NAME, departments.DEPARTMENT_ID, departments.DEPARTMENT_NAME
  FROM departments 
  INNER JOIN employees
    ON departments.DEPARTMENT_ID = employees.DEPARTMENT_ID;
```

Description: This query performs an inner join between the "departments" and "employees" tables based on the common column DEPARTMENT_ID. It retrieves the first name, last name, department ID, and department name of employees along with their corresponding department details.

Section 3: Question 8

Title: Retrieve Employee and Manager Information

SQL queries:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT(e.FIRST_NAME) AS "Employee", m.FIRST_NAME AS "Manager"
  FROM employees e, employees m WHERE e.MANAGER_ID=m.EMPLOYEE_ID;
```

```sql
SELECT 
  CONCAT(CONCAT(e.FIRST_NAME,' '), e.LAST_NAME) AS "Employee Name",
  CONCAT(CONCAT(m.FIRST_NAME,' '), m.LAST_NAME) AS "Manager Name"
FROM employees e 
  INNER JOIN employees m 
    ON e.MANAGER_ID = m.EMPLOYEE_ID;
```

Description: These queries retrieve the employee and manager information from the "employees" table. They identify employees and their corresponding managers by joining the "employees" table with itself based on the MANAGER_ID column. The first query uses a simple join condition, while the second query utilizes an inner join and concatenates the first name and last name for better readability of the results.
