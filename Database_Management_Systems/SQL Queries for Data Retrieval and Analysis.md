Sure! Here are the SQL queries along with the descriptions for each step within each section:

Section 1: Basic Commands

Title: Retrieve data from tables

1. Retrieve all records from the EMP table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM EMP;
```

Description: This query selects all columns and all rows from the EMP table, returning the complete dataset.

2. Retrieve all records from the DEPT table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM DEPT;
```

Description: This query selects all columns and all rows from the DEPT table, returning the complete dataset.

3. Retrieve the maximum salary from the EMP table:

```sql
SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP;
```

Description: This query calculates the maximum salary (SAL) from the EMP table using the MAX() function. It returns a single value representing the highest salary.

Section 2: Highest Salary

Title: Retrieve employee with the highest salary

SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM EMP 
    WHERE SAL = (SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP);
```

Description: This query identifies the employee with the highest salary from the EMP table. It does this by comparing each employee's salary (SAL) with the maximum salary obtained using a subquery. The subquery `(SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP)` retrieves the maximum salary, and the outer query selects the employee records where the salary matches the maximum value.

Section 3: Second Highest Salary

Title: Retrieve employee with the second highest salary

SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM EMP
    ORDER BY SAL DESC 
    OFFSET 1 ROWS
    FETCH FIRST 1 ROWS ONLY;
```

Description: This query retrieves the employee with the second highest salary from the EMP table. It achieves this by sorting the records in descending order based on the salary (SAL) using the ORDER BY clause. The OFFSET 1 ROWS clause skips the first record (highest salary), and the FETCH FIRST 1 ROWS ONLY clause fetches the next record, which represents the employee with the second highest salary.

Section 4: Task - Subqueries

Title: Subquery-based filtering

Question 1:

SQL query:

```sql
SELECT ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id, salesman_id 
  FROM Orders 
  WHERE salesman_id = 
    (SELECT salesman_id FROM Salesman WHERE name ='Paul Adam');
```

Description: This query retrieves the order details (ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id, and salesman_id) from the Orders table. It uses a subquery to filter the results based on the salesman_id. The subquery `(SELECT salesman_id FROM Salesman WHERE name ='Paul Adam')` retrieves the salesman_id corresponding to the salesman with the name 'Paul Adam'. The outer query selects the orders where the salesman_id matches the one obtained from the subquery.

Question 19:

SQL queries:

```sql
SELECT salesman_id, name, city, commission 
  FROM Salesman
  WHERE city IN 
    (SELECT city FROM customer 
       WHERE Salesman.salesman_id = customer.salesman_id);
```

Description: These queries retrieve the salesman details (salesman_id, name, city, commission) from the Salesman table. They use a subquery to filter the results based on the city. The subquery `(SELECT city FROM customer WHERE Salesman.salesman_id = customer.salesman_id)` retrieves the cities associated with the customers. The outer query selects the salesmen whose city is included in the set of cities obtained from the subquery.

Section 5: Task - Joins

Title: Joining tables

Question 1:

SQL query:

```sql
SELECT employees.FIRST_NAME, employees.LAST_NAME, departments.DEPARTMENT_ID
